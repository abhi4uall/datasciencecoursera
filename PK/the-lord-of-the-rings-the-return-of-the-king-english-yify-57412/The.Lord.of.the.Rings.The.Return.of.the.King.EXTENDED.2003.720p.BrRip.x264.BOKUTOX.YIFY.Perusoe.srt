1
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,150
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,590
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,220
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,500
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,540
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,800
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,570
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,450
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,730
Why?

10
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,070
Because...

11
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,010
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,300
My precious.

13
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,750
<i>They cursed us</i>.

14
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
<i>Murderer</i>.

15
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,960
<i>"Murderer" they called us</i>.

16
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,890
<i>They cursed us
and drove us away</i>.

17
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,720
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,630
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,730
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,300
<i>And we wept, precious</i>.

21
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,880
<i>We wept to be so alone</i>.

22
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,260
<i>--and cool
So nice for feet</i>

23
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,630
<i>And we only wish
To catch a fish</i>

24
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,060
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

25
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,940
<i>And we forgot the taste of bread</i>...

26
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,740
...<i>the sound of trees</i>...

27
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,810
...<i>the softness of the wind</i>.

28
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,120
<i>We even forgot our own name</i>.

29
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,670
<i>My precious</i>.

30
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,180
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,880
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,850
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,890
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,720
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,360
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,130
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,270
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,930
No.

39
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,010
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,210
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,980
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,420
Come on!

43
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,130
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,660
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,700
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,740
Here.

47
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,780
What about you?

48
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,350
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Sam.

50
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,420
All right.

51
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,090
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,170
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,240
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,840
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,000
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,370
For what?

57
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,780
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,960
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,230
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,630
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,460
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,800
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,890
It's good.

64
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,590
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,920
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,600
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,940
-Green Dragon.
-A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,680
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,720
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,560
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,000
...to Isengard!

72
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,100
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,270
...and now we find you feasting
and... and smoking!

74
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,650
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,310
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,220
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,130
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,770
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,730
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

80
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,300
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,070
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,650
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,480
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,650
...locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,660
Show yourself.

86
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,560
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,030
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,530
No.

90
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,210
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,770
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,880
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,520
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,650
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,020
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,130
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,160
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,400
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,300
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,210
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,470
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,180
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,320
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,490
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,960
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,530
Dotard!

107
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,840
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,330
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,410
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,610
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,720
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,250
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,820
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,290
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,730
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,470
I have some for you.

117
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,880
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,270
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,270
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,050
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,130
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,460
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,230
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,040
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:20,270
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,280
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,420
...those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,990
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,220
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,340
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,840
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,880
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,010
No.

134
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,710
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,820
-...and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,320
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,230
...your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,550
Grima, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,380
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,390
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,820
Come down.

143
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,690
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,860
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,700
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,570
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:57,540
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,780
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,820
Grima...

150
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,520
...come down.

151
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,290
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,420
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

153
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,460
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,500
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,270
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,970
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,710
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,410
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,070
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,150
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,810
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,980
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,980
...is washing away.

164
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,680
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,350
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,750
-Wild trees.
-Pippin!

167
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,440
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,200
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,280
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,020
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,730
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,340
Hail!

174
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,220
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,550
-No spills.
-And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,720
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,950
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,320
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,900
To victory!

180
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,540
I am happy for you.

181
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,320
He is an honorable man.

182
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,190
You are both honorable men.

183
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,360
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,400
Don't listen to me.

185
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,730
You are young.

186
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,200
And tonight is for you.

187
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,250
Here, here.

188
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,670
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,300
I feel something.

190
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,910
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,200
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,840
What did I say?

193
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,350
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,020
Game over.

195
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,630
<i>Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry</i>

196
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,740
<i>But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown</i>

197
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,310
<i>As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown</i>

198
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,380
<i>You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon</i>

199
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,710
<i>But the only brew for the brave and true</i>

200
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,650
Pippin!

201
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,150
<i>But the only brew for the brave and true</i>

202
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,190
<i>Comes from The Green Dragon</i>

203
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,730
Thank you! I win!

204
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,990
No news of Frodo?

205
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,660
No word. Nothing.

206
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,670
We have time.

207
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,440
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

208
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,270
Do we know that?

209
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,820
What does your heart tell you?

210
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,230
That Frodo is alive.

211
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,160
Yes.

212
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,900
Yes, he's alive.

213
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,010
Too risky. Too risky.

214
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,440
Thieves.

215
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,640
They stole it from us.

216
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,310
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

217
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,220
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

218
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,920
Mustn't ruin it now.

219
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,150
But they knows.

220
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,190
They knows.

221
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,990
They suspects us.

222
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,760
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

223
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,500
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

224
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,580
No. Not.

225
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,980
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

226
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,990
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

227
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,680
And we will.

228
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,920
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

229
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,890
It's ours!

230
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,730
Ours!

231
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,740
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

232
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,340
Patience! Patience, my love.

233
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,880
First we must lead them to her.

234
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,740
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

235
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,580
Yes, the stairs. And then?

236
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,750
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

237
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:39,360
...until we come to the tunnel.

238
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,860
And when they go in...

239
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,840
...there's no coming out.

240
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,610
She's always hungry.

241
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,580
She always needs to feed.

242
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,180
She must eat.

243
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,450
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

244
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,390
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

245
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,620
No.

246
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:08,530
Not very nice at all, my love.

247
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,500
She hungers for sweeter meats.

248
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,500
Hobbit meat.

249
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,470
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

250
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,740
...then we will find it.

251
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,240
And take it for me!

252
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,420
For us.

253
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,910
Yes. We meant "for us."

254
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,550
Gollum. Gollum.

255
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,220
The precious will be ours...

256
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,890
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

257
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
You treacherous little toad!

258
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,870
No! No! Master!

259
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,630
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

260
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,210
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

261
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,510
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

262
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,610
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

263
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,350
...who hates Sméagol...

264
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,320
...and who makes up nasty lies.

265
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,160
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

266
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,830
Sam!

267
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,500
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

268
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,400
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

269
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,700
-I won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

270
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,410
You don't see it, do you?

271
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,210
He's a villain.

272
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,840
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

273
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,590
I need you on my side.

274
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,690
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

275
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,160
I know, Sam. I know.

276
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,690
Trust me.

277
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,230
Come, Sméagol.

278
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,670
What time is it?

279
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,470
Not yet dawn.

280
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,440
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

281
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,610
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

282
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,320
I stood upon the brink.

283
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,420
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

284
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,130
A light shone behind me...

285
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,170
...but I could not turn.

286
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,770
I could only stand there, waiting.

287
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,940
Night changes many thoughts.

288
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,470
Sleep, Éowyn.

289
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,280
Sleep...

290
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,850
...while you can.

291
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,310
The stars are veiled.

292
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,810
Something stirs in the east.

293
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,610
A sleepless malice.

294
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,420
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

295
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,540
What are you doing?

296
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,650
Pippin!

297
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,890
Pippin?

298
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,100
Pippin.

299
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,430
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

300
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,740
Just one more time.

301
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,070
Put it back.

302
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,120
Pippin.

303
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,150
No!

304
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,470
Pippin.

305
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,040
He is here.

306
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,510
<i>I see you</i>.

307
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,110
Pippin!

308
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:19,530
Help! Gandalf, help!

309
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,130
Someone help him!

310
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,740
Pippin!

311
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,110
Fool of a Took!

312
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,430
Look at me.

313
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,500
Gandalf, forgive me.

314
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,580
Look at me.

315
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,580
What did you see?

316
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,140
A tree.

317
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,990
There was a white tree...

318
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,650
...in a courtyard of stone.

319
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,720
It was dead.

320
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,760
The city was burning.

321
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,300
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

322
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,000
I saw...

323
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,780
I saw him.

324
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,010
I could hear his voice in my head.

325
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,620
And what did you tell him?

326
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,620
Speak!

327
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,920
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

328
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,560
He hurt me.

329
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,200
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

330
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,170
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

331
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,240
A fool...

332
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,710
...but an honest fool he remains.

333
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,710
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

334
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,150
We've been strangely fortunate.

335
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,190
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

336
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,050
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

337
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,390
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

338
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,900
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

339
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,200
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

340
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,170
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

341
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,240
Sauron fears this.

342
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,740
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

343
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,320
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

344
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,980
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

345
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,090
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

346
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,220
Tell me...

347
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,200
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

348
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,900
What do we owe Gondor?

349
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,070
-I will go.
-No!

350
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,410
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

351
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,340
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

352
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,380
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

353
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,290
Understand this:

354
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,120
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

355
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,720
I ride for Minas Tirith...

356
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,630
...and I won't be going alone.

357
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,070
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

358
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,740
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,650
Where are we going?

360
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,040
Why did you look?

361
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,980
Why do you always have to look?

362
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,250
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

363
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,120
I'm sorry, all right?

364
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,130
-I won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

365
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,830
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

366
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,770
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

367
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:19,830
And you--? You're coming with me?

368
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,480
Merry?

369
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,940
Come on.

370
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,820
How far is Minas Tirith?

371
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,620
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

372
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,280
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

373
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,480
Here.

374
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,430
Something for the road.

375
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,300
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

376
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,460
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

377
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,130
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

378
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,970
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

379
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,010
I don't know what's going to happen.

380
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,880
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

381
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,520
Show us the meaning of haste.

382
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,590
Merry!

383
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,190
Merry!

384
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,170
He's always followed me...

385
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,870
...everywhere I went...

386
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,010
...since before we were tweens.

387
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,090
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

388
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,320
...but I was always there to get him out.

389
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,690
Now he's gone.

390
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,270
Just like Frodo and Sam.

391
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,630
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

392
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,470
They're a most hardy folk.

393
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,740
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

394
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,490
<i>Take her by the safest road</i>.

395
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,150
<i>A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens</i>.

396
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,200
<i>It waits to carry her across the sea</i>.

397
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,770
<i>The last journey of Arwen Undómiel</i>.

398
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,460
There is nothing for you here...

399
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,170
...only death.

400
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,750
Lady Arwen...

401
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,580
...we cannot delay.

402
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,280
My lady!

403
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,300
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

404
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,450
You have the gift of foresight.

405
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,410
What did you see?

406
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,380
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

407
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,050
But there is also life.

408
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,990
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

409
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,190
That future is almost gone.

410
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,330
But it is not lost.

411
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,130
Nothing is certain.

412
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,570
Some things are certain.

413
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,210
If I leave him now...

414
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,980
...I will regret it forever.

415
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,420
It is time.

416
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,460
<i>From the ashes a fire shall be woken</i>

417
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,030
<i>A light from the shadow shall spring</i>

418
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,500
<i>Renewed shall be blade that was broken</i>

419
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,110
<i>The crownless again shall be king</i>

420
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,910
Re-forge the sword.

421
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,490
Your hands are cold.

422
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,990
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

423
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,340
This was my choice.

424
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,440
Whether by your will or not...

425
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,080
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

426
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,130
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

427
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,040
Minas Tirith.

428
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,940
City of kings.

429
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,140
Make way!

430
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,170
It's the tree.

431
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,010
Gandalf. Gandalf.

432
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,440
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

433
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,410
The tree of the king.

434
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,250
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

435
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,120
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

436
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,390
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

437
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,730
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

438
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,660
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

439
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,270
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

440
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,010
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

441
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,640
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

442
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:04,890
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

443
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,230
Perhaps you come to explain this.

444
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,400
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

445
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,880
Boromir died to save us...

446
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,690
...my kinsman and me.

447
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,350
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

448
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,330
I offer you my service, such as it is...

449
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,900
...in payment of this debt.

450
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,410
This is my first command to you.

451
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,550
How did you escape
and my son did not...

452
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:06,220
...so mighty a man as he was?

453
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,220
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

454
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:12,390
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

455
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,260
Get up.

456
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:23,030
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

457
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,270
...but it is not now.

458
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:28,170
War is coming.

459
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,950
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

460
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,240
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

461
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,320
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

462
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:46,980
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

463
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,090
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

464
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,330
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

465
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:01,640
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

466
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,870
I have seen more than you know.

467
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:08,240
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

468
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,320
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

469
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,180
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

470
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:21,300
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

471
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,330
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

472
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,990
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

473
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:36,970
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

474
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,580
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

475
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,550
Come.

476
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,060
All has turned to vain ambition.

477
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:02,670
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

478
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:08,370
A thousand years
this city has stood.

479
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,880
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

480
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,280
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

481
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,970
...will never bloom again.

482
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:20,550
-Why are they still guarding it?
-They guard it because they have hope.

483
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,880
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

484
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,790
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

485
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,860
...before it fell into decay.

486
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,300
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

487
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,770
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

488
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,870
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

489
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,840
...dearer than the names of their sons.

490
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:50,040
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

491
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,590
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

492
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,520
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

493
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,830
The line of kings failed.

494
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,900
The White Tree withered.

495
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,800
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

496
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,740
Mordor.

497
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,950
Yes, there it lies.

498
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,120
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

499
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,760
A storm is coming.

500
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,360
This is not the weather of the world.

501
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,730
This is a device of Sauron's making.

502
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,670
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

503
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,710
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

504
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,710
...so he covers the face of the sun...

505
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,640
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

506
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:57,080
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

507
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,510
...it will begin.

508
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:02,750
Well...

509
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,460
...Minas Tirith...

510
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,790
...very impressive.

511
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,590
-So where are we off to next?
-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

512
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,960
There's no leaving this city.

513
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,530
Help must come to us.

514
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,700
It must be getting near teatime.

515
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,570
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

516
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,310
We're not in decent places.

517
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,120
Mr. Frodo?

518
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,390
What is it?

519
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,230
It's just a feeling.

520
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,800
I don't think I'll be coming back.

521
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,870
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

522
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,340
That's just morbid thinking.

523
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:03,280
We're going there and back again...

524
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:05,750
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

525
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,810
You'll see.

526
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,630
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

527
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:29,070
Long ago, when there was a king.

528
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,530
Mr. Frodo, look.

529
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,930
The king has got a crown again.

530
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:12,310
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

531
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:33,200
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

532
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:37,610
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

533
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,710
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

534
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,250
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

535
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,780
Ridiculous Hobbit.

536
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,190
Guard of the Citadel.

537
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,540
Thank you.

538
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,180
There's no more stars.

539
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,880
Is it time?

540
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,780
Yes.

541
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,090
It's so quiet.

542
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,360
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

543
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:36,400
I don't want to be in a battle...

544
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:42,200
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

545
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,380
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

546
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,810
There never was much hope.

547
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,520
Just a fool's hope.

548
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,230
Our enemy is ready.

549
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,030
His full strength's gathered.

550
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,700
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

551
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,930
<i>Legions of Haradrim from the south</i>...

552
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,810
...<i>mercenaries from the coast</i>.

553
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,540
<i>All will answer Mordor's call</i>.

554
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,270
Come on.

555
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,720
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

556
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,290
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

557
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:36,560
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

558
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,390
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

559
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:44,630
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

560
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,100
Gandalf?

561
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,480
<i>Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant</i>...

562
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:03,750
...<i>the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war</i>.

563
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,120
<i>The one they say no living man can kill</i>.

564
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,290
The Witch-king of Angmar.

565
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,730
You've met him before.

566
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,000
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

567
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,240
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

568
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,180
...<i>the greatest of the Nine</i>.

569
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:34,550
<i>Minas Morgul is his lair</i>.

570
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,950
The Dead City.

571
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:47,360
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

572
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,740
Quick. Quick.

573
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,900
They will see. They will see.

574
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,460
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

575
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:19,500
The way into Mordor.

576
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:23,070
The secret stair.

577
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,800
Climb.

578
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,820
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

579
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,540
-What's it doing?
-No.

580
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,800
-They're calling me.
-No.

581
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,410
Hide! Hide!

582
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,820
I can feel his blade.

583
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,590
We come to it at last.

584
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,300
The great battle of our time.

585
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,740
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

586
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,620
The board is set.

587
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:36,290
The pieces are moving.

588
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,560
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

589
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,360
And then it's into the tunnel.

590
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,770
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

591
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,070
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

592
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,150
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

593
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:55,870
One sniff something's not right...

594
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,250
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

595
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,120
No more slinker. No more stinker.

596
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,080
You're gone. Got it?

597
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,950
I'm watching you.

598
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,290
What was that about?

599
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,870
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

600
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,380
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

601
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:32,140
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

602
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,550
You must not fail me.

603
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,890
It's been very quiet across the river.

604
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:18,390
The Orcs are lying low.

605
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:20,560
The garrison may have moved out.

606
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,400
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

607
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:27,870
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

608
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,390
Quiet.

609
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,440
We need 10 more.

610
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,290
Kill him!

611
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,010
They're not coming from the north.

612
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:48,790
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

613
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,820
Faster.

614
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:09,340
Draw swords.

615
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,460
Hold! Hold them!

616
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:28,650
What?

617
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:42,630
Amon Dîn.

618
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,460
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

619
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:58,940
Hope is kindled.

620
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:35,710
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

621
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,540
Gondor calls for aid.

622
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,960
And Rohan will answer.

623
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:55,160
Muster the Rohirrim.

624
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,210
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

625
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,780
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

626
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:22,220
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

627
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:24,520
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

628
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,020
-Gamling.
-My lord.

629
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,780
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

630
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,050
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

631
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,820
I will.

632
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:39,100
-Will you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

633
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:43,170
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

634
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,650
The men have found their captain.

635
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,150
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

636
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,880
You have given us hope.

637
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,060
Excuse me.

638
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,890
I have a sword.

639
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,560
Please accept it.

640
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:12,190
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

641
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,700
And gladly I accept it.

642
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:22,870
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

643
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,980
Horse-Men.

644
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:35,250
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

645
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,600
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

646
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:42,200
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

647
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:04,110
<i>So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith</i>...

648
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:08,190
...<i>the doom of our time will be decided</i>.

649
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:16,290
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

650
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:20,030
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

651
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,080
Faramir!

652
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,090
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

653
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,720
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

654
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,770
Nazgûl.

655
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,610
Take cover!

656
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,310
Nazgûl!

657
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,150
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

658
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,590
Fall back!

659
01:11:56,670 --> 01:12:01,230
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Run for your lives!

660
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,830
The age of Men is over.

661
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,600
The time of the Orc has come.

662
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,310
-Keep going.
-It's the Nazgûl.

663
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,310
Take cover, my lord!

664
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:45,950
It's coming!

665
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,890
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

666
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:36,230
Pull!

667
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,350
Mithrandir.

668
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,290
They broke through our defenses.

669
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:00,650
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

670
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,890
-Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
-It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

671
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:10,630
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

672
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:16,410
Faramir?

673
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:22,180
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

674
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,540
No.

675
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,410
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

676
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,720
-Where? When?
-In Ithilien.

677
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:33,980
Not two days ago.

678
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:38,890
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

679
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:42,230
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

680
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,840
What does that mean?

681
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:51,910
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

682
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,140
Tell me all you know.

683
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:58,720
This is how you would serve your city?

684
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,180
You would risk its utter ruin?

685
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,810
I did what I judged to be right.

686
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,520
What you judged to be right.

687
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:15,030
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

688
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:23,840
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

689
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,000
Hidden.

690
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:30,140
Dark and deep in the vaults...

691
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,510
...not to be used.

692
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:41,560
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

693
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,050
I would not use the Ring.

694
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:47,290
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

695
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:52,470
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

696
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,900
...as a king of old.

697
01:15:56,710 --> 01:16:00,440
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

698
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,310
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

699
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:06,070
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

700
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:09,610
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

701
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:12,050
-You know nothing of this matter!
-He would have kept it for his own.

702
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,090
And when he returned...

703
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,890
...you would not have known your son.

704
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:21,590
Boromir was loyal to me!

705
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:24,330
Not some wizard's pupil!

706
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,810
Father?

707
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:48,430
My son.

708
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,020
Leave me.

709
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:52,150
Careful, master. Careful.

710
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,390
Very far to fall.

711
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:01,800
Very dangerous are the stairs.

712
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,030
Come, master.

713
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:15,970
Come to Sméagol.

714
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,850
Mr. Frodo.

715
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,380
Get back, you!

716
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,750
Don't touch him!

717
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,730
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

718
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,600
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

719
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:42,140
Master?

720
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:46,400
Master carries heavy burden.

721
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:51,980
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

722
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:55,420
Fat one cannot know.

723
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,220
Sméagol look after master.

724
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:03,620
He wants it.

725
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,320
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

726
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:13,960
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

727
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:18,010
The fat one will take it from you.

728
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:29,590
Send forth all legions.

729
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,780
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

730
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:37,620
Slay them all.

731
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:45,070
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

732
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,840
Where are Théoden's riders?

733
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:53,600
Will Rohan's army come?

734
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:56,010
Mithrandir.

735
01:19:57,050 --> 01:20:00,950
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

736
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,450
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

737
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:16,230
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

738
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,890
It was well-done.

739
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:25,100
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

740
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,400
You are to join the tower guard.

741
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:31,970
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

742
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:34,590
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

743
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,310
A very foolish one...

744
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:40,720
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

745
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:43,660
-This was yours?
-Yes, it was mine.

746
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,590
My father had it made for me.

747
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:48,000
Well...

748
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,140
...I'm taller than you were then.

749
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,670
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

750
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:58,670
Never fitted me either.

751
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,640
Boromir was always the soldier.

752
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,080
They were so alike, he and my father.

753
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:10,780
Proud.

754
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,180
Stubborn even.

755
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:15,420
But strong.

756
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:20,090
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

757
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:23,200
And one day your father will see it.

758
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:31,140
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

759
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:32,800
...in peace or war...

760
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:35,910
...in living or dying...

761
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,510
...from...

762
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,980
From this hour henceforth...

763
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,090
...until my lord release me...

764
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,790
...or death take me.

765
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,850
And I shall not forget it...

766
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:56,430
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

767
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,310
Fealty with love.

768
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,040
Valor with honor.

769
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:13,980
Disloyalty with vengeance.

770
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:26,690
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

771
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,630
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

772
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,290
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

773
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:35,240
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

774
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:37,070
Osgiliath must be retaken.

775
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,300
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

776
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,740
Much must be risked in war.

777
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:49,340
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

778
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,830
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

779
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:02,600
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

780
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,770
Yes.

781
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:10,670
I wish that.

782
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:21,540
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

783
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:26,290
...I will do what I can
in his stead.

784
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:38,930
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

785
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,630
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

786
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,290
What are you up to?

787
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,690
Sneaking off, are we?

788
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:14,230
Sneaking?

789
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,430
Sneaking?

790
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,000
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

791
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:27,270
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

792
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:29,570
...and they say "sneak."

793
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:32,810
Sneak?

794
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:36,150
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

795
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,920
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

796
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:42,390
You just startled me is all.

797
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,730
What were you doing?

798
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:48,490
Sneaking.

799
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:51,930
Fine. Have it your own way.

800
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:56,700
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

801
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,040
We have to be moving on.

802
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,770
It's dark still.

803
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:08,180
It's always dark here.

804
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,360
It's gone!

805
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,430
-The Elven bread.
-What?

806
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,060
That's all we have left.

807
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,630
He took it. He must have!

808
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,400
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

809
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,480
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

810
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,840
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

811
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,540
He doesn't eat it.

812
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,880
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

813
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,750
What's this?

814
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:50,760
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

815
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,120
He took it.

816
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:58,160
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

817
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,130
That's a filthy lie!

818
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,540
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

819
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:03,940
-Sam!
-Call me--

820
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,340
Stop it!

821
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,570
Sam!

822
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:12,480
-I'll kill him!
-Sam! No!

823
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:19,080
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

824
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:21,380
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

825
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,620
-I'm all right.
-No.

826
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,890
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

827
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:29,160
It's that Gollum.

828
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:31,060
It's this place.

829
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:33,800
It's that thing around your neck.

830
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:38,610
I could help a bit.

831
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:41,440
I could carry it for a while.

832
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:43,340
Carry it for a while.

833
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,780
I could carry it... I could carry it.

834
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:50,860
Share the load... Share the load...
the load... the load.

835
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,250
Get away!

836
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:53,980
I don't want to keep it.

837
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,550
I just want to help.

838
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:04,230
See? See?

839
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,840
He wants it for himself.

840
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:09,700
Shut up, you!

841
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,110
Go away!
Get out of here!

842
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,110
No, Sam.

843
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,510
It's you.

844
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,410
I'm sorry, Sam.

845
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,490
But he's a liar.

846
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:27,320
He's poisoned you against me.

847
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:30,660
You can't help me anymore.

848
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,500
You don't mean that.

849
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,800
Go home.

850
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,610
Faramir!

851
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,690
Faramir!

852
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,250
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

853
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,450
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

854
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:12,530
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

855
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,100
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

856
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:19,500
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

857
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:22,900
...her memory, her wisdom.

858
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,680
Your father loves you, Faramir.

859
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:32,410
He will remember it
before the end.

860
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,540
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

861
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:47,910
Well...

862
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:50,090
...yes.

863
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,560
At least, well enough
for my own people.

864
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,600
But we have no songs
for great halls...

865
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,900
...and evil times.

866
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:04,900
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

867
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:09,110
Come, sing me a song.

868
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,530
<i>Home is behind</i>

869
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,430
<i>The world ahead</i>

870
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:35,670
<i>And there are many paths to tread</i>

871
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,040
<i>Through shadow</i>

872
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:45,340
<i>To the edge of night</i>

873
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:52,120
<i>Until the stars are all alight</i>

874
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:59,460
<i>Mist and shadow</i>

875
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:03,930
<i>Cloud and shade</i>

876
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:09,640
<i>All shall fade</i>

877
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:16,000
<i>All shall</i>

878
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:24,150
<i>Fade</i>

879
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:53,780
March! March! March!

880
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:57,380
March! March!

881
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,190
Make way for the king.

882
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,690
Make way.

883
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:11,190
The king is here.

884
01:34:13,170 --> 01:34:14,800
My lord.

885
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,010
Hail to you, sire.

886
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,670
Grimbold, how many?

887
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,280
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

888
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,910
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

889
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:31,010
-Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
-None have come, my lord.

890
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:50,200
Six thousand spears.

891
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,230
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

892
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:56,910
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

893
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,410
More will come.

894
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:04,760
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

895
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,480
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

896
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:29,310
The horses are restless...

897
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,970
...and the men are quiet.

898
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:34,580
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

899
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,920
That road there...

900
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,920
...where does that lead?

901
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:46,490
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

902
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:50,220
None who venture there ever return.

903
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,300
That mountain is evil.

904
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:18,090
Aragorn.

905
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:20,730
Let's find some food.

906
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:38,650
There.

907
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:42,590
A true esquire of Rohan.

908
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,220
I'm ready.

909
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,090
Sorry.

910
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,530
It isn't all that dangerous.

911
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:56,360
It's not even sharp.

912
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,440
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

913
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:02,100
Come on.

914
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:08,800
To the smithy. Go!

915
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:12,770
You should not encourage him.

916
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,420
You should not doubt him.

917
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:18,890
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

918
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:23,190
Why should Merry be left behind?

919
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,990
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

920
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:31,290
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

921
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:37,560
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

922
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,900
When the fear takes him...

923
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:46,110
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

924
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,680
...do you think he would stand and fight?

925
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:52,850
He would flee.

926
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,050
And he would be right to do so.

927
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,220
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

928
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:40,600
<i>I choose a mortal life</i>.

929
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:46,410
I wish I could've seen him...

930
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:50,240
...one last time.

931
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:02,830
Sir?

932
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:07,220
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

933
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:29,990
I take my leave.

934
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:45,860
My lord Elrond.

935
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:49,930
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

936
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,040
Arwen is dying.

937
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:03,880
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

938
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:08,020
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

939
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:12,190
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

940
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:16,090
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

941
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:19,430
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

942
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,500
The end has come.

943
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:24,470
It will not be our end, but his.

944
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:28,800
You ride to war, but not to victory.

945
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:33,510
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

946
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:38,090
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

947
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,960
<i>A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south</i>.

948
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:44,650
They'll be in the city in two days.

949
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:48,030
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

950
01:40:48,730 --> 01:40:50,860
You need more men.

951
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,960
There are none.

952
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:58,640
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

953
01:41:07,650 --> 01:41:09,810
Murderers...

954
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:11,420
...traitors.

955
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,050
You would call upon them to fight?

956
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:17,790
They believe in nothing.

957
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,090
They answer to no one.

958
01:41:20,260 --> 01:41:23,320
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

959
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:35,610
Andûril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

960
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:54,500
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

961
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:13,320
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

962
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:15,890
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

963
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,930
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

964
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,920
Put aside the Ranger.

965
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:27,430
Become who you were born to be.

966
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,630
Take the Dimholt road.

967
01:42:33,245 --> 01:42:35,840
I give hope to Men.

968
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:43,960
I keep none for myself.

969
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:57,320
Why are you doing this?

970
01:42:57,770 --> 01:43:00,960
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

971
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,500
You cannot abandon the men.

972
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:08,370
Éowyn...

973
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:10,740
We need you here.

974
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,740
Why have you come?

975
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:17,380
Do you not know?

976
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:29,690
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

977
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,000
I cannot give you what you seek.

978
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:53,450
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

979
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:14,900
Just where do you think
you're off to?

980
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,410
Not this time.

981
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,770
This time you must stay, GimIi.

982
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,320
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

983
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:28,150
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

984
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,640
-What's happening?
-Where is he going?

985
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:54,850
Where's he going?

986
01:44:57,450 --> 01:44:59,480
I don't understand.

987
01:45:03,890 --> 01:45:05,690
Lord Aragorn!

988
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:08,820
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

989
01:45:10,030 --> 01:45:12,120
He leaves because there is no hope.

990
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:14,890
He leaves because he must.

991
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:16,800
Too few have come.

992
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:19,100
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

993
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,270
No...

994
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:24,970
...we cannot.

995
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:31,650
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

996
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:47,800
I have left instruction.

997
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:53,740
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

998
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:02,580
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

999
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:06,650
Long may you defend Edoras...

1000
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:09,150
...if the battle goes ill.

1001
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:13,660
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1002
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:17,830
Duty?

1003
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,370
No.

1004
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,770
I would have you smile again...

1005
01:46:35,220 --> 01:46:40,180
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1006
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:48,550
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1007
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:55,630
...and no more despair.

1008
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,540
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1009
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:07,540
One that is cursed.

1010
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:12,040
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1011
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:15,250
...to the last king of Gondor...

1012
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:17,420
...to come to his aid...

1013
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:19,290
...to fight.

1014
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:21,950
But when the time came...

1015
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,190
...when Gondor's need was dire...

1016
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:27,270
...they fled...

1017
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:30,800
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1018
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,170
And so Isildûr cursed them...

1019
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:39,580
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1020
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:47,050
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1021
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:49,750
The forgotten people.

1022
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,450
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1023
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:54,790
From the north shall he come.

1024
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:56,960
Need shall drive him.

1025
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:01,520
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1026
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:23,320
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1027
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:30,800
The way is shut.

1028
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:33,530
It was made by those
who are dead.

1029
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:36,400
And the Dead keep it.

1030
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:38,460
The way is shut.

1031
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:51,320
Brego!

1032
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:57,550
I do not fear death.

1033
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,270
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1034
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:17,100
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1035
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,610
Oh.

1036
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:21,610
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1037
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:38,860
We must ride light and swift.

1038
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:40,800
It is a long road ahead.

1039
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:44,030
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1040
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:52,570
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1041
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:54,880
All my friends have gone to battle.

1042
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:56,950
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1043
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,210
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1044
01:49:59,390 --> 01:50:01,790
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1045
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:04,920
I want to fight.

1046
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:07,420
I will say no more.

1047
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:26,180
Ride with me.

1048
01:50:27,650 --> 01:50:29,050
My lady.

1049
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,580
Form up! Move out!

1050
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,980
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,290
Ride!

1052
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:42,390
Ride now to Gondor!

1053
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,770
What is it?

1054
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:27,500
What do you see?

1055
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:29,870
I see shapes of men.

1056
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:33,910
And of horses.

1057
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:35,880
Where?

1058
01:51:36,050 --> 01:51:38,980
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1059
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:43,620
Spears rise...

1060
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:47,720
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1061
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,120
The Dead are following.

1062
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:53,860
They have been summoned.

1063
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:56,330
The Dead?

1064
01:51:56,740 --> 01:51:58,430
Summoned?

1065
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,740
I knew that.

1066
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,810
Very good.

1067
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:08,610
Very good! Legolas!

1068
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:47,990
Do not look down.

1069
01:53:40,570 --> 01:53:45,710
<i>Who enters my domain?</i>

1070
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:51,680
One who will have your allegiance.

1071
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:59,990
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1072
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:02,960
You will suffer me.

1073
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:29,890
The way is shut.

1074
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:35,490
It was made by those who are dead.

1075
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:40,060
And the Dead keep it.

1076
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:52,270
The way is shut.

1077
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:56,640
Now you must die.

1078
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:03,390
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1079
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:08,660
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1080
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:16,430
That line was broken.

1081
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:21,270
It has been remade.

1082
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,710
Fight for us...

1083
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,440
...and regain your honor.

1084
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:38,960
What say you?

1085
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:52,700
What say you?

1086
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:55,240
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1087
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:58,610
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

1088
01:55:59,110 --> 01:56:01,580
I am Isildûr's heir.

1089
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,120
Fight for me...

1090
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,280
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1091
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:14,160
What say you?

1092
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:24,260
You have my word!

1093
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:28,560
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1094
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:31,530
What say you?!

1095
01:56:34,850 --> 01:56:37,820
Stand, you traitors!

1096
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:05,770
Out!

1097
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:28,730
Legolas!

1098
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,060
Run!

1099
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:39,460
We fight.

1100
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:52,380
Open the gate! Quick!

1101
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:25,410
Quick! Hurry!

1102
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,830
Faramir!

1103
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,070
Say not that he has fallen.

1104
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:47,760
They were outnumbered.

1105
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:49,770
None survived.

1106
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:52,480
Fear.

1107
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:56,240
The city is rank with it.

1108
01:59:58,590 --> 02:00:01,050
Let us ease their pain.

1109
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:03,050
Release the prisoners.

1110
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:05,190
Catapults!

1111
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:21,970
My sons are spent.

1112
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:25,940
My line has ended.

1113
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:30,180
He's alive!

1114
02:00:30,350 --> 02:00:33,510
The House of Stewards has failed.

1115
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:35,150
He needs medicine, my lord.

1116
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:38,850
My line has ended!

1117
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:42,360
My lord!

1118
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:57,740
Rohan...

1119
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,880
...has deserted us.

1120
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:18,530
Théoden's betrayed me.

1121
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,510
Abandon your posts!

1122
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:36,480
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1123
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,150
Prepare for battle!

1124
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:51,860
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1125
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:55,000
Over here!

1126
02:01:55,740 --> 02:01:58,140
Return to your posts!

1127
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:11,540
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1128
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:23,200
Stay where you are.

1129
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:41,580
We need more rubble!

1130
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:43,610
Watch out!

1131
02:02:43,780 --> 02:02:46,340
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1132
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:49,750
Double up, men!

1133
02:03:58,730 --> 02:04:01,720
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1134
02:04:02,260 --> 02:04:05,720
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1135
02:04:46,410 --> 02:04:48,030
Not at the towers!

1136
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:51,200
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1137
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:53,780
Bring them down!

1138
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:30,940
Fight them back!

1139
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:33,110
Peregrin Took!

1140
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:37,180
-Go back to the Citadel!
-They'd called us out to fight.

1141
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:55,240
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1142
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:22,845
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1143
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:26,370
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1144
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:40,690
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1145
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:42,820
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1146
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:51,560
Get back there and smash it down.

1147
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:53,720
But nothing can breach it.

1148
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:58,930
Grond will breach it.

1149
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:04,430
Bring up the wolf's head.

1150
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:12,950
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1151
02:07:13,290 --> 02:07:17,090
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1152
02:07:19,030 --> 02:07:22,960
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1153
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:26,830
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1154
02:07:27,230 --> 02:07:31,400
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1155
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:35,120
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1156
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:51,090
You may go no further.

1157
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,270
You will not enter Gondor.

1158
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:00,040
Who are you to deny us passage?

1159
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:03,940
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1160
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,630
Mind your aim.

1161
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,360
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1162
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:19,080
Prepare to be boarded.

1163
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:21,720
Boarded?

1164
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:23,550
By you and whose army?

1165
02:08:25,090 --> 02:08:27,390
This army.

1166
02:08:44,080 --> 02:08:45,910
In there.

1167
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:49,450
What is this place?

1168
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:57,260
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1169
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:02,620
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1170
02:09:04,730 --> 02:09:06,960
It's the only way.

1171
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:11,360
Go in...

1172
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:14,100
...or go back.

1173
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:19,580
I can't go back.

1174
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,460
-What's that smell?
-Orcses' filth.

1175
02:09:34,630 --> 02:09:37,860
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1176
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:44,740
Hurry.

1177
02:09:49,610 --> 02:09:51,540
This way.

1178
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:56,180
Sméagol?

1179
02:09:57,150 --> 02:09:59,310
Over here.

1180
02:10:07,630 --> 02:10:10,790
It's sticky. What is it?

1181
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:13,260
You'll see.

1182
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:15,730
Oh, yes.

1183
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:19,070
You will see.

1184
02:10:27,980 --> 02:10:29,640
Sméagol?

1185
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:32,210
Sméagol!

1186
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:36,860
Sméagol!

1187
02:10:46,130 --> 02:10:48,070
Sam.

1188
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:30,260
<i>And you, Frodo Baggins</i>...

1189
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:35,810
...<i>I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star</i>.

1190
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:39,880
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places</i>...

1191
02:12:40,050 --> 02:12:43,920
...<i>when all other lights go out</i>.

1192
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:03,230
<i>Naughty little fly</i>

1193
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:06,590
<i>Why does he cry?</i>

1194
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:10,500
<i>Caught in a web</i>

1195
02:14:10,670 --> 02:14:13,400
<i>Soon you'll be</i>...

1196
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:15,610
Eaten.

1197
02:14:52,780 --> 02:14:55,480
Got away, did it, precious?

1198
02:14:55,650 --> 02:14:57,780
Not this time.

1199
02:14:57,950 --> 02:15:01,050
-Not this time!
-No!

1200
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:11,230
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1201
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:14,290
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1202
02:15:14,470 --> 02:15:16,370
We promised.

1203
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:19,040
You must believe us.

1204
02:15:19,210 --> 02:15:20,940
It was the precious.

1205
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:25,910
The precious made us do it.

1206
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,900
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1207
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:58,280
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1208
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:09,750
No!

1209
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:35,410
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1210
02:16:39,890 --> 02:16:42,480
I'm so sorry.

1211
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:13,050
<i>This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire</i>.

1212
02:17:14,190 --> 02:17:16,590
<i>If you do not find a way</i>...

1213
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:19,090
...<i>no one will</i>.

1214
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:55,660
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1215
02:17:55,830 --> 02:17:58,130
The lower level's in flames.

1216
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:01,030
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1217
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,430
Time is against us.

1218
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,330
Make ready!

1219
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,340
Take heart, Merry.

1220
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:08,700
It will soon be over.

1221
02:18:09,310 --> 02:18:10,900
My lady...

1222
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:14,070
...you are fair and brave...

1223
02:18:14,380 --> 02:18:16,820
...and have much to live for...

1224
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:20,550
...and many who love you.

1225
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:26,090
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1226
02:18:26,630 --> 02:18:29,820
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1227
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:34,470
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1228
02:18:34,630 --> 02:18:37,730
But I'm not.

1229
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:39,740
I'm a Hobbit.

1230
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,970
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1231
02:18:48,350 --> 02:18:50,680
I just want to help my friends.

1232
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:54,280
Frodo.

1233
02:18:55,060 --> 02:18:56,850
Sam.

1234
02:18:58,430 --> 02:19:00,480
Pippin.

1235
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:04,990
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1236
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:11,530
Prepare to move out!

1237
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:14,500
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1238
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:32,460
To battle.

1239
02:19:32,890 --> 02:19:34,380
To battle.

1240
02:19:57,420 --> 02:19:59,210
Back to the gate!

1241
02:19:59,490 --> 02:20:01,680
Hurry!

1242
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:26,070
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1243
02:20:26,250 --> 02:20:28,610
Thus have I walked.

1244
02:20:29,820 --> 02:20:32,910
And thus now will I sleep.

1245
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,090
Gondor is lost.

1246
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:45,000
There is no hope for Men.

1247
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:02,450
Why do the fools fly?

1248
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:07,040
Better to die sooner than late.

1249
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:11,280
For die we must.

1250
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:26,460
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1251
02:21:27,570 --> 02:21:33,600
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1252
02:21:33,780 --> 02:21:38,950
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1253
02:21:42,590 --> 02:21:44,420
Bring wood and oil.

1254
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:48,590
Steady.

1255
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:50,820
Steady.

1256
02:22:05,210 --> 02:22:07,770
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1257
02:22:08,010 --> 02:22:12,450
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1258
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:20,090
Run!

1259
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:23,520
Volley!

1260
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:26,160
Fire!

1261
02:24:19,310 --> 02:24:21,340
Let him go, you filth.

1262
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:24,940
Let him go!

1263
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:28,350
You will not touch him again.

1264
02:24:31,490 --> 02:24:33,360
Come on and finish it.

1265
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:24,690
Back!

1266
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:36,810
Mr. Frodo.

1267
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:48,350
Oh, no.

1268
02:26:48,530 --> 02:26:50,500
Frodo.

1269
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:52,660
Mr. Frodo.

1270
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:58,600
Wake up.

1271
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:04,810
Don't leave me here alone.

1272
02:27:06,310 --> 02:27:08,750
Don't go where I can't follow.

1273
02:27:13,050 --> 02:27:14,450
Wake up.

1274
02:27:21,130 --> 02:27:23,320
Not asleep.

1275
02:27:25,470 --> 02:27:27,370
Dead.

1276
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:47,640
You get back, you scum!

1277
02:27:57,230 --> 02:27:58,560
What's this?

1278
02:27:59,730 --> 02:28:02,500
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1279
02:28:04,470 --> 02:28:07,000
Killed another one, has she?

1280
02:28:07,210 --> 02:28:09,170
No.

1281
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:13,870
This fellow ain't dead.

1282
02:28:14,210 --> 02:28:16,480
Not dead?

1283
02:28:16,650 --> 02:28:22,450
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1284
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:25,550
Then she has her way with them.

1285
02:28:25,890 --> 02:28:27,590
That's how she likes to feed.

1286
02:28:28,090 --> 02:28:30,220
Fresh blood.

1287
02:28:30,400 --> 02:28:32,730
Get him to the tower!

1288
02:28:36,170 --> 02:28:37,900
Samwise, you fool.

1289
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:40,900
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1290
02:28:41,070 --> 02:28:43,570
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1291
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:11,100
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1292
02:29:12,140 --> 02:29:13,610
He is burning.

1293
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:16,070
Already burning.

1294
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:18,430
He's not dead.

1295
02:29:18,910 --> 02:29:20,570
He's not dead!

1296
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:24,550
No! No!

1297
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:27,080
No! No!

1298
02:29:27,250 --> 02:29:29,240
He's not dead!

1299
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:33,080
-Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
-No! No! No!

1300
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:36,560
I release you from my service.

1301
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:42,230
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1302
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:46,770
Pour oil on the wood!

1303
02:29:48,470 --> 02:29:50,500
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1304
02:29:51,010 --> 02:29:53,910
-Hurry along there! Hurry along!
-Gandalf!

1305
02:29:54,310 --> 02:29:55,750
Where is Gandalf?

1306
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,280
Gandalf!

1307
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:04,780
Retreat!

1308
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:08,690
The city is breached!

1309
02:30:08,860 --> 02:30:11,830
Fall back to the second level!

1310
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:17,190
Get the women and children out!

1311
02:30:17,570 --> 02:30:19,330
Get them out!

1312
02:30:19,510 --> 02:30:21,000
Retreat!

1313
02:30:21,170 --> 02:30:22,970
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:30:23,310 --> 02:30:27,540
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1315
02:30:35,560 --> 02:30:37,990
Take them down!

1316
02:30:58,510 --> 02:31:01,380
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1317
02:31:01,550 --> 02:31:02,840
Fight for your lives!

1318
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:04,240
Gandalf!

1319
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:09,990
Gandalf!

1320
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,750
Denethor has lost his mind!

1321
02:31:12,930 --> 02:31:15,220
He's burning Faramir alive!

1322
02:31:15,390 --> 02:31:17,190
Up! Quickly!

1323
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,490
Go back to the abyss.

1324
02:31:27,010 --> 02:31:30,200
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1325
02:31:30,380 --> 02:31:36,840
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1326
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:41,720
This is my hour.

1327
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:52,820
Gandalf!

1328
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:05,270
You have failed.

1329
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,880
The world of Men will fall.

1330
02:33:08,170 --> 02:33:09,640
Courage, Merry.

1331
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:12,180
Courage for our friends.

1332
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:18,810
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1333
02:33:18,990 --> 02:33:22,220
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1334
02:33:30,330 --> 02:33:33,460
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1335
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:34,890
Flank ready.

1336
02:33:35,070 --> 02:33:37,930
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1337
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:41,840
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1338
02:33:42,010 --> 02:33:44,740
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1339
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:48,740
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1340
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:54,180
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1341
02:33:54,390 --> 02:33:58,080
...a sword-day, a red day...

1342
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:01,850
...ere the sun rises!

1343
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:13,940
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1344
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:22,370
Ride now!

1345
02:34:23,850 --> 02:34:25,980
Ride now!

1346
02:34:26,590 --> 02:34:29,350
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1347
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:32,290
...and the world's ending!

1348
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:35,630
Death!

1349
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,960
Death!

1350
02:34:39,130 --> 02:34:42,360
-Death!
-Death!

1351
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:44,390
-Death!
-Death!

1352
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:48,540
-Death!
-Death!

1353
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:56,080
Forth Eorlingas!

1354
02:35:39,020 --> 02:35:40,790
Fire!

1355
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:45,790
Death!

1356
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,300
Charge!

1357
02:35:51,740 --> 02:35:53,330
Fire at will!

1358
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:53,960
Set a fire in our flesh.

1359
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:13,380
Stay this madness!

1360
02:37:17,690 --> 02:37:22,290
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1361
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:26,460
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1362
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:29,860
...there is no victory.

1363
02:37:59,100 --> 02:38:00,830
No!

1364
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,660
You will not take my son from me!

1365
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:06,170
No! No!

1366
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,780
Faramir.

1367
02:38:32,330 --> 02:38:36,290
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1368
02:39:03,830 --> 02:39:05,590
Drive them to the river!

1369
02:39:08,370 --> 02:39:10,360
Make safe the city!

1370
02:39:50,380 --> 02:39:52,310
Re-form the line!

1371
02:39:53,450 --> 02:39:55,410
Re-form the line!

1372
02:40:02,420 --> 02:40:05,050
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1373
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:07,820
Charge!

1374
02:41:26,740 --> 02:41:28,210
Cut him down!

1375
02:41:54,870 --> 02:41:57,460
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1376
02:41:59,870 --> 02:42:01,130
Left!

1377
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:20,220
Aim for their heads!

1378
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:29,500
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1379
02:42:43,350 --> 02:42:44,870
Merry!

1380
02:43:58,290 --> 02:44:00,320
I didn't think it would end this way.

1381
02:44:01,630 --> 02:44:03,030
End?

1382
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:06,390
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1383
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:12,030
Death is just another path...

1384
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:14,300
...one that we all must take.

1385
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:19,000
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1386
02:44:19,180 --> 02:44:22,810
...and all turns to silver glass.

1387
02:44:24,980 --> 02:44:26,920
And then you see it.

1388
02:44:28,850 --> 02:44:31,220
What, Gandalf?

1389
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:33,690
See what?

1390
02:44:34,930 --> 02:44:37,120
White shores...

1391
02:44:38,830 --> 02:44:41,230
...and beyond.

1392
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:44,460
A far green country...

1393
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:48,100
...under a swift sunrise.

1394
02:44:52,140 --> 02:44:53,670
Well...

1395
02:44:53,850 --> 02:44:55,510
...that isn't so bad.

1396
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,080
No.

1397
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:00,780
No, it isn't.

1398
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:20,500
Rally to me! To me!

1399
02:45:41,290 --> 02:45:45,820
Feast on his flesh.

1400
02:45:50,170 --> 02:45:52,530
I will kill you if you touch him.

1401
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:58,170
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1402
02:47:06,580 --> 02:47:09,780
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1403
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:12,450
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1404
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:15,850
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1405
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:33,430
There's plenty for the both of us.

1406
02:47:33,610 --> 02:47:35,700
May the best Dwarf win.

1407
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:55,390
You fool.

1408
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:58,960
No man can kill me.

1409
02:48:01,330 --> 02:48:04,500
Die now.

1410
02:48:15,180 --> 02:48:17,170
I am no man.

1411
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:37,190
-Sixteen!
-Seventeen!

1412
02:48:45,010 --> 02:48:46,940
Merry!

1413
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:30,720
Legolas!

1414
02:49:53,110 --> 02:49:55,510
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1415
02:50:42,590 --> 02:50:44,960
That still only counts as one!

1416
02:50:45,130 --> 02:50:47,290
Come on, then. Come on!

1417
02:51:31,010 --> 02:51:33,840
I know your face...

1418
02:51:35,710 --> 02:51:37,580
...Éowyn.

1419
02:51:40,150 --> 02:51:42,520
My eyes darken.

1420
02:51:43,660 --> 02:51:45,020
No.

1421
02:51:45,860 --> 02:51:47,480
No.

1422
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:52,060
I am going to save you.

1423
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:55,760
You already did.

1424
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:01,030
Éowyn...

1425
02:52:02,540 --> 02:52:05,030
...my body is broken.

1426
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:12,550
You have to let me go.

1427
02:52:18,460 --> 02:52:21,020
I go to my fathers...

1428
02:52:22,490 --> 02:52:25,330
...in whose mighty company...

1429
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:29,100
...I shall not now feel ashamed.

1430
02:52:45,720 --> 02:52:47,340
Éowyn.

1431
02:53:33,830 --> 02:53:36,300
Release us.

1432
02:53:38,240 --> 02:53:39,930
Bad idea.

1433
02:53:40,100 --> 02:53:43,940
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1434
02:53:44,110 --> 02:53:46,100
You gave us your word.

1435
02:53:47,880 --> 02:53:49,970
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1436
02:53:51,320 --> 02:53:52,650
Go.

1437
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:55,210
Be at peace.

1438
02:54:38,530 --> 02:54:40,460
Merry.

1439
02:54:41,030 --> 02:54:44,260
No!

1440
02:54:48,170 --> 02:54:50,610
No!

1441
02:55:14,370 --> 02:55:18,230
<i>With a sigh</i>

1442
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:22,130
<i>You turn away</i>

1443
02:55:22,310 --> 02:55:26,270
<i>With a deepening heart</i>

1444
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:31,210
<i>No more words to say</i>

1445
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:34,940
<i>You will find</i>

1446
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:39,150
<i>That the world has changed</i>

1447
02:55:39,320 --> 02:55:43,420
<i>Forever</i>

1448
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:15,920
<i>And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold</i>

1449
02:56:19,800 --> 02:56:25,130
<i>And the sun is now fading</i>

1450
02:56:25,300 --> 02:56:31,940
<i>I wish I could hold you</i>

1451
02:56:32,110 --> 02:56:34,770
<i>Closer</i>

1452
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:38,910
Merry!

1453
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:42,540
Merry!

1454
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:55,700
Merry.

1455
02:56:58,170 --> 02:56:59,430
Merry, it's me.

1456
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:03,600
It's Pippin.

1457
02:57:06,110 --> 02:57:08,370
I knew you'd find me.

1458
02:57:08,550 --> 02:57:09,770
Yes.

1459
02:57:12,180 --> 02:57:14,280
Are you going to leave me?

1460
02:57:14,820 --> 02:57:16,510
No, Merry.

1461
02:57:17,820 --> 02:57:20,050
I'm going to look after you.

1462
02:58:04,070 --> 02:58:05,500
Hands off!

1463
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:08,830
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1464
02:58:09,070 --> 02:58:13,240
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1465
02:58:14,780 --> 02:58:18,610
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1466
02:58:19,480 --> 02:58:24,650
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1467
02:58:45,340 --> 02:58:47,110
The scum tried to knife me.

1468
02:58:47,280 --> 02:58:49,040
Kill him!

1469
03:00:32,250 --> 03:00:34,240
That's for Frodo!

1470
03:00:34,650 --> 03:00:36,750
And for the Shire!

1471
03:00:40,360 --> 03:00:42,490
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1472
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:15,290
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1473
03:01:16,430 --> 03:01:21,160
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1474
03:01:28,510 --> 03:01:30,170
Not if I stick you first.

1475
03:01:30,340 --> 03:01:31,870
Sam!

1476
03:01:36,910 --> 03:01:38,940
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1477
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:41,180
Sorry for everything.

1478
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:45,320
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1479
03:01:45,490 --> 03:01:48,390
They've taken it. Sam...

1480
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:50,650
...they took the Ring.

1481
03:01:51,430 --> 03:01:54,130
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1482
03:02:06,110 --> 03:02:08,310
I thought I'd lost you.

1483
03:02:08,710 --> 03:02:10,410
So l took it.

1484
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:13,640
Only for safekeeping.

1485
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:16,650
Give it to me.

1486
03:02:20,220 --> 03:02:22,420
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1487
03:02:27,100 --> 03:02:28,330
Sam.

1488
03:02:29,930 --> 03:02:31,900
Give me the Ring.

1489
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:53,890
You must understand.

1490
03:02:57,390 --> 03:02:59,230
The Ring is my burden.

1491
03:03:00,430 --> 03:03:02,560
It will destroy you, Sam.

1492
03:03:05,740 --> 03:03:07,700
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1493
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:10,670
We best find you some clothes.

1494
03:03:10,840 --> 03:03:13,870
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1495
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:37,830
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:38,340 --> 03:03:40,630
We made it to Mordor.

1497
03:03:41,970 --> 03:03:43,630
There are so many of them.

1498
03:03:44,580 --> 03:03:47,170
We'll never get through unseen.

1499
03:03:52,320 --> 03:03:55,650
It's him, the Eye.

1500
03:04:03,360 --> 03:04:05,950
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1501
03:04:06,430 --> 03:04:08,490
There's nothing for it.

1502
03:04:11,470 --> 03:04:15,910
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1503
03:04:25,250 --> 03:04:28,510
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1504
03:04:29,850 --> 03:04:32,650
The darkness is deepening.

1505
03:04:32,860 --> 03:04:35,220
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1506
03:04:35,390 --> 03:04:37,420
It's only a matter of time.

1507
03:04:38,930 --> 03:04:41,330
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1508
03:04:42,400 --> 03:04:46,890
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1509
03:04:47,070 --> 03:04:48,900
Let him stay there.

1510
03:04:49,070 --> 03:04:51,740
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1511
03:04:51,910 --> 03:04:57,070
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1512
03:05:03,820 --> 03:05:08,280
-I've sent him to his death.
-No.

1513
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:12,090
There is still hope for Frodo.

1514
03:05:12,430 --> 03:05:16,560
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1515
03:05:17,640 --> 03:05:20,230
-We can give him that.
-How?

1516
03:05:20,540 --> 03:05:23,270
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1517
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:25,530
Empty his lands.

1518
03:05:25,780 --> 03:05:28,840
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1519
03:05:29,480 --> 03:05:32,470
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1520
03:05:32,650 --> 03:05:34,210
Not for ourselves.

1521
03:05:34,450 --> 03:05:40,010
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1522
03:05:41,830 --> 03:05:45,630
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1523
03:05:46,360 --> 03:05:47,590
A diversion.

1524
03:05:47,770 --> 03:05:49,530
Certainty of death...

1525
03:05:49,700 --> 03:05:52,460
...small chance of success...

1526
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:54,930
...what are we waiting for?

1527
03:05:55,510 --> 03:05:57,940
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1528
03:05:58,710 --> 03:06:00,770
He will not take the bait.

1529
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:04,750
Oh, I think he will.

1530
03:06:39,180 --> 03:06:41,810
Long have you hunted me.

1531
03:06:42,690 --> 03:06:43,950
Long have I eluded you.

1532
03:06:45,820 --> 03:06:47,380
No more.

1533
03:06:49,090 --> 03:06:51,530
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1534
03:07:36,010 --> 03:07:38,530
The city has fallen silent.

1535
03:07:40,210 --> 03:07:43,240
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1536
03:07:44,010 --> 03:07:45,740
It grows so cold.

1537
03:07:48,750 --> 03:07:51,780
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1538
03:07:58,160 --> 03:08:01,390
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1539
03:08:30,030 --> 03:08:31,590
Look, the Orcs...

1540
03:08:32,130 --> 03:08:34,120
...they're moving off.

1541
03:08:35,170 --> 03:08:37,260
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1542
03:08:37,430 --> 03:08:39,770
...some luck at last.

1543
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:41,770
Move it, you slugs!

1544
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:46,440
Come on! Faster!

1545
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:57,680
Come along, you scum...

1546
03:08:57,860 --> 03:09:02,120
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1547
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,590
Come on!

1548
03:09:06,760 --> 03:09:09,130
What have I told you?!

1549
03:09:15,970 --> 03:09:17,460
Get up!

1550
03:09:17,840 --> 03:09:20,500
Come on, you slugs!

1551
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:24,310
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1552
03:09:24,480 --> 03:09:29,380
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1553
03:09:42,370 --> 03:09:46,200
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1554
03:09:55,580 --> 03:09:59,170
Don't you know we're at war?

1555
03:10:21,470 --> 03:10:24,340
Company, halt!

1556
03:10:28,210 --> 03:10:31,580
Inspection!

1557
03:10:31,750 --> 03:10:34,180
Sam, help me.

1558
03:10:34,380 --> 03:10:36,220
Mr. Frodo!

1559
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:41,450
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1560
03:10:41,630 --> 03:10:43,460
It's so heavy.

1561
03:10:52,600 --> 03:10:53,760
Oh, no.

1562
03:10:59,410 --> 03:11:01,380
What do I do?
What do we do?

1563
03:11:04,450 --> 03:11:05,610
-Hit me.
-What?

1564
03:11:05,780 --> 03:11:07,810
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1565
03:11:07,990 --> 03:11:09,540
Get off of me!

1566
03:11:10,220 --> 03:11:12,590
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1567
03:11:21,200 --> 03:11:23,260
Get off of me!

1568
03:11:24,170 --> 03:11:26,100
Break it up! Break it up!

1569
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:33,170
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1570
03:11:33,380 --> 03:11:35,710
Go, Sam. Now!

1571
03:11:44,660 --> 03:11:46,180
Move along, scum!

1572
03:11:46,360 --> 03:11:48,260
Back in the line!

1573
03:11:48,760 --> 03:11:50,560
You maggots!

1574
03:11:51,230 --> 03:11:54,220
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1575
03:11:56,670 --> 03:12:00,130
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1576
03:12:02,840 --> 03:12:04,810
Move it!

1577
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:50,940
I can't...

1578
03:12:51,120 --> 03:12:54,890
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1579
03:12:55,090 --> 03:12:56,220
It's... It's...

1580
03:12:56,390 --> 03:12:58,950
It's such a weight to carry.

1581
03:12:59,860 --> 03:13:00,850
It...

1582
03:13:01,030 --> 03:13:03,000
Such a weight.

1583
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:10,440
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1584
03:13:11,910 --> 03:13:15,000
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1585
03:13:30,190 --> 03:13:32,020
Mr. Frodo.

1586
03:13:33,530 --> 03:13:35,020
Look.

1587
03:13:37,630 --> 03:13:39,470
There is light...

1588
03:13:39,800 --> 03:13:42,200
...and beauty up there...

1589
03:13:42,370 --> 03:13:44,100
...that no shadow can touch.

1590
03:14:35,160 --> 03:14:36,790
Take mine.

1591
03:14:37,290 --> 03:14:39,390
There's a few drops left.

1592
03:14:54,640 --> 03:14:57,200
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1593
03:14:58,110 --> 03:15:01,310
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1594
03:15:54,200 --> 03:15:56,370
Frodo, get down!

1595
03:15:58,110 --> 03:16:00,010
Hide!

1596
03:16:10,150 --> 03:16:12,180
Frodo!

1597
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:19,460
Where are they?

1598
03:16:55,530 --> 03:16:58,590
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1599
03:16:59,500 --> 03:17:02,340
Let justice be done upon him!

1600
03:17:45,850 --> 03:17:49,790
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1601
03:17:55,630 --> 03:17:59,360
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1602
03:17:59,730 --> 03:18:02,860
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1603
03:18:03,030 --> 03:18:06,000
...faithless and accursed.

1604
03:18:06,170 --> 03:18:09,570
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1605
03:18:09,740 --> 03:18:12,400
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1606
03:18:13,440 --> 03:18:15,970
Old Greybeard.

1607
03:18:17,410 --> 03:18:21,710
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1608
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:28,050
Frodo.

1609
03:18:30,890 --> 03:18:32,360
Frodo.

1610
03:18:33,330 --> 03:18:34,560
-Silence.
-No!

1611
03:18:35,400 --> 03:18:36,730
Silence!

1612
03:18:38,540 --> 03:18:42,270
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1613
03:18:43,270 --> 03:18:47,330
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1614
03:18:52,880 --> 03:18:58,620
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1615
03:19:01,260 --> 03:19:03,380
And he did, Gandalf.

1616
03:19:03,560 --> 03:19:05,290
He did.

1617
03:19:12,300 --> 03:19:13,790
And who is this?

1618
03:19:13,970 --> 03:19:16,030
Isildûr's heir?

1619
03:19:16,210 --> 03:19:19,200
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1620
03:19:23,980 --> 03:19:26,570
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1621
03:19:28,690 --> 03:19:29,910
I do not believe it.

1622
03:19:31,890 --> 03:19:33,290
I will not.

1623
03:19:49,370 --> 03:19:51,170
Pull back.

1624
03:19:51,470 --> 03:19:53,500
Pull back!

1625
03:20:05,720 --> 03:20:07,750
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1626
03:20:10,230 --> 03:20:13,220
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1627
03:20:13,430 --> 03:20:15,230
Something's drawn its gaze.

1628
03:20:32,750 --> 03:20:35,510
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1629
03:20:37,590 --> 03:20:41,580
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1630
03:20:44,460 --> 03:20:46,360
I see in your eyes...

1631
03:20:46,730 --> 03:20:50,760
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1632
03:20:52,740 --> 03:20:56,670
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1633
03:20:56,840 --> 03:21:00,110
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1634
03:21:00,280 --> 03:21:02,940
But it is not this day.

1635
03:21:03,250 --> 03:21:06,270
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1636
03:21:06,450 --> 03:21:09,320
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1637
03:21:09,490 --> 03:21:11,950
But it is not this day.

1638
03:21:12,120 --> 03:21:13,780
This day we fight!

1639
03:21:15,630 --> 03:21:19,930
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1640
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:24,330
...I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1641
03:22:52,820 --> 03:22:56,350
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1642
03:22:56,830 --> 03:22:59,160
What about side by side with a friend?

1643
03:23:02,700 --> 03:23:04,460
Aye.

1644
03:23:05,300 --> 03:23:07,060
I could do that.

1645
03:23:37,400 --> 03:23:39,460
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1646
03:23:42,440 --> 03:23:44,700
It'll be spring soon.

1647
03:23:45,510 --> 03:23:48,200
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1648
03:23:48,380 --> 03:23:52,040
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1649
03:23:53,420 --> 03:23:57,410
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1650
03:23:58,450 --> 03:24:02,820
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1651
03:24:04,760 --> 03:24:07,250
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1652
03:24:08,870 --> 03:24:10,560
No, Sam.

1653
03:24:10,730 --> 03:24:13,670
I can't recall the taste of food...

1654
03:24:14,800 --> 03:24:18,100
...nor the sound of water...

1655
03:24:18,270 --> 03:24:21,870
...nor the touch of grass.

1656
03:24:22,810 --> 03:24:24,340
I'm...

1657
03:24:25,250 --> 03:24:26,610
...naked in the dark.

1658
03:24:28,280 --> 03:24:30,580
There's-- There's nothing.

1659
03:24:30,750 --> 03:24:35,450
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1660
03:24:36,690 --> 03:24:38,630
I can see him...

1661
03:24:39,060 --> 03:24:40,690
...with my waking eyes.

1662
03:24:41,760 --> 03:24:44,230
Then let us be rid of it...

1663
03:24:44,800 --> 03:24:47,070
...once and for all.

1664
03:24:47,770 --> 03:24:49,830
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1665
03:24:50,010 --> 03:24:52,630
I can't carry it for you...

1666
03:24:53,080 --> 03:24:55,100
...but I can carry you.

1667
03:24:55,650 --> 03:24:57,410
Come on!

1668
03:25:27,810 --> 03:25:30,750
<i>Aragorn</i>.

1669
03:25:42,330 --> 03:25:44,920
<i>Elessar</i>.

1670
03:25:56,910 --> 03:25:59,340
For Frodo.

1671
03:26:34,280 --> 03:26:35,770
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1672
03:26:36,480 --> 03:26:38,710
A doorway.

1673
03:26:39,280 --> 03:26:40,940
We're almost there.

1674
03:26:43,290 --> 03:26:47,250
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1675
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:02,870
Mustn't go that way.

1676
03:27:04,410 --> 03:27:06,840
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1677
03:27:07,010 --> 03:27:08,770
You swore!

1678
03:27:08,950 --> 03:27:11,040
You swore on the precious!

1679
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:14,850
Sméagol promised!

1680
03:27:15,790 --> 03:27:17,780
Sméagol lied.

1681
03:28:10,310 --> 03:28:12,170
Frodo!

1682
03:28:39,270 --> 03:28:41,030
Eagles.

1683
03:28:42,440 --> 03:28:43,930
The eagles are coming!

1684
03:29:06,760 --> 03:29:08,660
Frodo!

1685
03:29:13,900 --> 03:29:15,200
I'm here, Sam.

1686
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:24,270
Destroy it!

1687
03:29:34,860 --> 03:29:38,120
Go on! Now!

1688
03:29:38,290 --> 03:29:40,850
Throw it in the fire!

1689
03:29:54,240 --> 03:29:56,910
What are you waiting for?

1690
03:29:58,780 --> 03:30:01,150
Just let it go!

1691
03:30:34,350 --> 03:30:36,610
The Ring is mine.

1692
03:30:40,160 --> 03:30:41,920
No.

1693
03:30:42,320 --> 03:30:43,620
No.

1694
03:30:52,030 --> 03:30:54,700
No!

1695
03:32:39,140 --> 03:32:41,010
Yes!

1696
03:32:42,210 --> 03:32:43,910
Yes!

1697
03:32:45,050 --> 03:32:47,910
Precious! Precious!

1698
03:32:48,080 --> 03:32:51,250
Precious! Precious!

1699
03:33:44,170 --> 03:33:46,000
Give me your hand!

1700
03:33:54,350 --> 03:33:56,780
Take my hand!

1701
03:33:59,460 --> 03:34:00,750
No!

1702
03:34:08,030 --> 03:34:10,000
Don't you let go.

1703
03:34:14,570 --> 03:34:16,160
Don't let go.

1704
03:34:17,770 --> 03:34:19,240
Reach!

1705
03:35:48,430 --> 03:35:51,300
Frodo!

1706
03:35:51,870 --> 03:35:54,890
Frodo!

1707
03:37:16,250 --> 03:37:18,080
It's gone.

1708
03:37:22,560 --> 03:37:24,320
It's done.

1709
03:37:24,790 --> 03:37:26,780
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1710
03:37:28,200 --> 03:37:30,600
It's over now.

1711
03:37:56,260 --> 03:37:58,620
I can see the Shire.

1712
03:38:00,830 --> 03:38:03,160
The Brandywine River.

1713
03:38:05,300 --> 03:38:07,290
Bag End.

1714
03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:12,330
Gandalf's fireworks.

1715
03:38:12,770 --> 03:38:16,540
The lights in the Party Tree.

1716
03:38:18,010 --> 03:38:21,140
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1717
03:38:22,280 --> 03:38:24,980
She had ribbons in her hair.

1718
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:30,860
If ever I was to marry someone...

1719
03:38:31,790 --> 03:38:34,020
...it would've been her.

1720
03:38:35,460 --> 03:38:37,520
It would've been her.

1721
03:38:49,750 --> 03:38:52,910
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1722
03:38:57,190 --> 03:39:00,120
...here at the end of all things.

1723
03:40:49,800 --> 03:40:51,820
Gandalf?

1724
03:41:11,490 --> 03:41:13,480
Frodo!

1725
03:41:33,280 --> 03:41:35,110
Gimli!

1726
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:21,850
Now come the days of the king.

1727
03:43:26,860 --> 03:43:29,150
May they be blessed.

1728
03:43:49,440 --> 03:43:52,110
This day does not belong to one man...

1729
03:43:52,280 --> 03:43:54,150
...but to all.

1730
03:43:55,820 --> 03:43:58,750
Let us together rebuild this world...

1731
03:43:58,920 --> 03:44:03,150
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1732
03:46:37,650 --> 03:46:39,740
My friends...

1733
03:46:45,020 --> 03:46:47,680
...you bow to no one.

1734
03:47:31,870 --> 03:47:33,990
<i>And thus it was</i>.

1735
03:47:34,170 --> 03:47:37,800
<i>A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began</i>.

1736
03:47:37,970 --> 03:47:40,500
<i>And the Fellowship of the Ring</i>...

1737
03:47:40,680 --> 03:47:45,170
...<i>though eternally bound
by friendship and love</i>...

1738
03:47:45,350 --> 03:47:47,780
...<i>was ended</i>.

1739
03:47:52,790 --> 03:47:57,550
<i>Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey</i>...

1740
03:47:57,730 --> 03:48:01,960
...<i>we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight</i>.

1741
03:48:04,500 --> 03:48:07,200
<i>We were home</i>.

1742
03:48:13,740 --> 03:48:15,640
Hi.

1743
03:48:32,830 --> 03:48:35,020
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1744
03:49:23,110 --> 03:49:24,670
More of the same, Rosie.

1745
03:49:24,850 --> 03:49:26,840
Good night, lads.

1746
03:50:24,440 --> 03:50:28,430
<i>How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?</i>

1747
03:50:29,740 --> 03:50:31,970
<i>How do you go on</i>...

1748
03:50:32,150 --> 03:50:37,350
...<i>when in your heart
you begin to understand</i>...

1749
03:50:38,620 --> 03:50:41,560
...<i>there is no going back?</i>

1750
03:50:42,260 --> 03:50:45,920
<i>There are some things
that time cannot mend</i>...

1751
03:50:46,460 --> 03:50:49,360
...<i>some hurts that go too deep</i>...

1752
03:50:51,130 --> 03:50:53,970
...<i>that have taken hold</i>.

1753
03:51:32,110 --> 03:51:33,970
Mr. Frodo?

1754
03:51:37,350 --> 03:51:38,710
What is it?

1755
03:51:40,550 --> 03:51:44,480
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1756
03:51:45,190 --> 03:51:47,880
It's never really healed.

1757
03:51:51,830 --> 03:51:57,090
<i>"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale</i>
by Bilbo Baggins.

1758
03:51:57,870 --> 03:52:01,630
And <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
by Frodo Baggins."

1759
03:52:02,140 --> 03:52:04,300
You finished it.

1760
03:52:07,180 --> 03:52:08,700
Not quite.

1761
03:52:09,510 --> 03:52:12,070
There's room for a little more.

1762
03:52:14,720 --> 03:52:18,910
<i>Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end</i>...

1763
03:52:19,090 --> 03:52:22,390
...<i>that each of us must come and go
in the telling</i>.

1764
03:52:23,260 --> 03:52:26,090
<i>Bilbo's story was now over</i>.

1765
03:52:26,590 --> 03:52:29,500
<i>There would be no more journeys
for him</i>...

1766
03:52:29,660 --> 03:52:31,220
...<i>save one</i>.

1767
03:52:31,970 --> 03:52:35,530
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1768
03:52:35,700 --> 03:52:37,690
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1769
03:52:37,870 --> 03:52:40,600
The Elves have accorded you
a special honor...

1770
03:52:40,780 --> 03:52:43,400
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1771
03:52:45,110 --> 03:52:46,770
Frodo...

1772
03:52:48,180 --> 03:52:52,710
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1773
03:52:53,350 --> 03:52:55,620
The one I gave you.

1774
03:52:59,230 --> 03:53:01,390
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1775
03:53:03,970 --> 03:53:06,560
I'm afraid I lost it.

1776
03:53:06,730 --> 03:53:08,530
Oh.

1777
03:53:09,170 --> 03:53:10,640
Pity.

1778
03:53:13,370 --> 03:53:17,240
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1779
03:53:46,410 --> 03:53:51,440
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1780
03:54:05,660 --> 03:54:08,960
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1781
03:54:09,760 --> 03:54:12,560
The time has come...

1782
03:54:12,730 --> 03:54:16,030
...for the dominion of Men.

1783
03:54:17,074 --> 03:54:20,148
The sea calls us home.

1784
03:54:28,420 --> 03:54:30,580
I think I'm...

1785
03:54:30,750 --> 03:54:35,120
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1786
03:55:06,190 --> 03:55:08,490
Farewell...

1787
03:55:08,660 --> 03:55:11,420
...my brave Hobbits.

1788
03:55:13,360 --> 03:55:15,390
My work is now finished.

1789
03:55:19,300 --> 03:55:24,170
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1790
03:55:24,840 --> 03:55:27,670
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1791
03:55:31,210 --> 03:55:33,740
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1792
03:55:34,380 --> 03:55:38,410
...for not all tears are an evil.

1793
03:55:55,970 --> 03:55:57,870
It is time, Frodo.

1794
03:56:03,440 --> 03:56:05,410
What does he mean?

1795
03:56:07,880 --> 03:56:10,750
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1796
03:56:12,350 --> 03:56:15,080
And it has been saved.

1797
03:56:18,790 --> 03:56:21,420
But not for me.

1798
03:56:22,360 --> 03:56:24,830
You don't mean that.

1799
03:56:26,030 --> 03:56:28,130
You can't leave.

1800
03:56:36,580 --> 03:56:39,310
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1801
04:00:12,390 --> 04:00:15,260
<i>My dear Sam:</i>

1802
04:00:17,160 --> 04:00:20,500
<i>You cannot always be torn in two</i>.

1803
04:00:20,670 --> 04:00:24,800
<i>You will have to be one and whole
for many years</i>.

1804
04:00:25,570 --> 04:00:31,010
<i>You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do</i>.

1805
04:00:32,280 --> 04:00:35,440
<i>Your part in the story will go on</i>.

1806
04:00:36,180 --> 04:00:37,950
Well...

1807
04:00:39,820 --> 04:00:41,550
...I'm back.

1808
04:02:24,160 --> 04:02:28,150
<i>Lay down</i>

1809
04:02:29,730 --> 04:02:34,130
<i>Your sweet and weary head</i>

1810
04:02:35,870 --> 04:02:39,430
<i>Night is falling</i>

1811
04:02:40,110 --> 04:02:44,940
<i>You have come
To journey's end</i>

1812
04:02:45,610 --> 04:02:49,380
<i>Sleep now</i>

1813
04:02:49,550 --> 04:02:55,220
<i>And dream
Of the ones who came before</i>

1814
04:02:56,960 --> 04:03:00,890
<i>They are calling</i>

1815
04:03:01,060 --> 04:03:05,160
<i>From across
The distant shore</i>

1816
04:03:06,770 --> 04:03:11,700
<i>Why do you weep?</i>

1817
04:03:11,870 --> 04:03:16,830
<i>What are these tears
Upon your face?</i>

1818
04:03:17,010 --> 04:03:22,070
<i>Soon you will see</i>

1819
04:03:22,250 --> 04:03:27,210
<i>All of your fears
Will pass away</i>

1820
04:03:27,390 --> 04:03:32,450
<i>Safe in my arms</i>

1821
04:03:32,630 --> 04:03:37,120
<i>You're only sleeping</i>

1822
04:03:37,300 --> 04:03:42,290
<i>What can you see</i>

1823
04:03:42,470 --> 04:03:47,700
<i>On the horizon?</i>

1824
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:52,400
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

1825
04:03:52,580 --> 04:03:57,280
<i>Call?</i>

1826
04:03:58,450 --> 04:04:03,050
<i>Across the sea</i>

1827
04:04:03,220 --> 04:04:08,490
<i>A pale moon rises</i>

1828
04:04:08,660 --> 04:04:11,360
<i>The ships have come</i>

1829
04:04:11,530 --> 04:04:17,330
<i>To carry you home</i>

1830
04:04:19,570 --> 04:04:24,140
<i>And all will turn</i>

1831
04:04:24,310 --> 04:04:29,650
<i>To silver glass</i>

1832
04:04:29,820 --> 04:04:34,050
<i>A light on the water</i>

1833
04:04:34,220 --> 04:04:39,720
<i>All souls pass</i>

1834
04:04:39,890 --> 04:04:44,130
<i>Hope fades</i>

1835
04:04:45,670 --> 04:04:50,570
<i>Into the world of night</i>

1836
04:04:51,310 --> 04:04:55,110
<i>Through shadows falling</i>

1837
04:04:55,940 --> 04:05:01,070
<i>Out of memory and time</i>

1838
04:05:01,780 --> 04:05:05,510
<i>Don't say</i>

1839
04:05:06,320 --> 04:05:11,280
<i>We have come now to the end</i>

1840
04:05:12,160 --> 04:05:16,560
<i>White shores are calling</i>

1841
04:05:16,730 --> 04:05:20,260
<i>You and I will meet again</i>

1842
04:05:20,430 --> 04:05:26,900
<i>And you'll be here
In my arms</i>

1843
04:05:28,110 --> 04:05:32,200
<i>Just sleeping</i>

1844
04:05:32,380 --> 04:05:37,210
<i>What can you see</i>

1845
04:05:37,380 --> 04:05:42,340
<i>On the horizon?</i>

1846
04:05:42,520 --> 04:05:47,290
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

1847
04:05:47,460 --> 04:05:52,900
<i>Call?</i>

1848
04:05:53,070 --> 04:05:58,130
<i>Across the sea</i>

1849
04:05:58,310 --> 04:06:03,300
<i>A pale moon rises</i>

1850
04:06:03,480 --> 04:06:06,280
<i>The ships have come</i>

1851
04:06:06,450 --> 04:06:12,780
<i>To carry you home</i>

1852
04:06:13,990 --> 04:06:19,120
<i>And all will turn</i>

1853
04:06:19,730 --> 04:06:24,530
<i>To silver glass</i>

1854
04:06:24,700 --> 04:06:28,830
<i>A light on the water</i>

1855
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:32,870
<i>Grey ships pass</i>

1856
04:06:33,040 --> 04:06:38,710
<i>Into the West</i>
